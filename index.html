        <h2>An Open Letter to Anyone and No One</h2>
        <p>
            If you had told me when I was younger that I would some day be writing online I would have cringed at the thought. If you had told me earlier this year the answer would have been the same… yet here we are.
            <br><br>
            I suppose this has come about as a way for me to express and share my thoughts in a manor that I hope will find an audience of like minded people. As the title suggests this will be an honest account, perhaps even the first one I have put out publicly despite not being my first attempt at expression online.
            <br><br>
            Some things you should know about me before we go any further:
            <br><br>
            I am a deeply depressive person and not for a lack of trying. There is a notion that the four pillars; exercise, sleep, diet and relationships; will fix everything and well I would like to offer a counter to that in the form of my own mental health. I have struggled with issues such as identity, addiction, nihilism and have been clinically diagnosed with PTSD and depression.
            <br><br>
            I am a very extreme person I have come to find there is no safe middle ground for me, I am either all in or all out.
            <br><br>
            
            Notable things to date:
            <br><br>
            -	I was intoxicated everyday for 2 years and then did another 2 completely sober<br>
            -	I have my IRD number tattooed on the back of my neck<br>
            -	I have been writing since 2018<br>
            -	Worked my way from bartender to business insights analyst without a degree<br>
            -	Started a small designer clothing label called SAD Collection<br>
            -	Hosted a podcast called “Unhappy Hour”<br>
            -	Have a vlog called “A Dull Life”
            <br><br>
            It is strange to distil your life into a few key bullet points I like to try and think of life as chapters in a book even down to the level of giving them titles. You will come to learn that I am not without my intricacies and that my internal dialogue is often far deeper than anything I dear articulate, words once spoken can not be withdrawn. This project however will reveal my inner most world, so welcome.

            What am I writing now,<br>
            Everything is coming out,<br>
            Side of things I can’t pronounce,<br>
            In a dream my own account,<br>
            <br>
            Not looking for don’t want an out,<br>
            Connect into my deeper self,<br>
            A figure I don’t let him out,<br>
            A trigger to the way I felt,<br>
            <br>
            Identify but don’t allow,<br>
            Easier to hide the doubt,<br>
            Distracting what I might amount,<br>
            Contact and ghost is what a sought,<br>
            <br>
            Invest in hope the common route,<br>
            Tie the rope jump from the spout,<br>
            The institution hangs around,<br>
            Can’t escape what’s in ourselves,<br>
            <br>

            Watch me slip back into old habits,<br>
            I catch it but still unpacking what happen,<br>
            I’m spirit lacking,<br>
            Unhappy and I’m erratic,<br>
            <br>
            Can’t fathom being abandoned,<br>
            I’m adamantly alone,<br>
            Leave me inside of my home,<br>
            Don’t leave unless I want,<br>
            <br>
            It’s unhealthy to assume,<br>
            Different beings with different cues,<br>
            Going out I always lose,<br>
            In my head theres lots of rooms,<br>
            <br>
            Many paths I could pursue,<br>
            Very dark and full of gloom,<br>
            Known to me but not to you,<br>
            So fuck off.<br>
            <br>

            When shit become just like going through motions,<br>
            Starting to feel like I only have one emotion,<br>
            I’m just artist expressing in focus,<br>
            In black and white a dull life is it hopeless,<br>
            <br>
            A smoke I light just to cloudy the whole pic,<br>
            In front of mics where I only produce dope shit,<br>
            Caught in a fight with somebody I can’t win,<br>
            Quite voices who hide in the open,<br>
            <br>
            Was a mistake to lean into the darkness,<br>
            I carry lanterns a bic and a dart lit,<br>
            And now these places not far from where I live,<br>
            Can’t escape them there under my eyelids,<br>
            <br>
            Paved the way eyes wide open I can’t miss,<br>
            And when I say this know that I will not quit,<br>
            On my grave it reads roped in he strived shit,<br>
            Can’t argue when I spit.<br>
            <br>
